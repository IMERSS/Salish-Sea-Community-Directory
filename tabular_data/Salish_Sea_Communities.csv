The Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) and Double- crested Cormorant (P. auritus) are fish-eating predators that are important indicators of ecosystem health. We conducted a complete survey of nesting colonies in 2000 and 2014, and partial surveys in the intervening period, as well as compiling data from 1955 – 2015. Temporal trends in nest numbers were estimated using a mixed effects model lme4 package in R. A population model was used to predict values at each location, for each year in a time series, then summed to estimate total nests per year. Our main goals are to better understand how and why cormorant populations are changing and to provide scientific data to inform colony management both in Canada and the USA.","Harry R.
