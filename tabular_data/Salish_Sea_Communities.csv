The Initiative has created a centralized interactive map that pulls together information about the Sound’s ocean to support informed decision-making, collaborative management, marine spatial planning, and community education.",Andrew Simon,,https://howesoundguide.ca/contact-us/,,NA,Átl'ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound,https://howesoundguide.ca
"science, monitoring, education, stewardship",Coastal and Ocean Resources,ShoreZone,Coastal and Ocean Resources - ShoreZone,"ShoreZone takes a close-up inventory of the biology and geology of North America’s Pacific coast from Oregon to Alaska and in-between. People use the coastal data, imagery, and maps to manage the coast for the benefit of the many animals and plants, people and industries who depend on it. ShoreZone’s baseline data improves our ability to understand, respond to, and plan for the dynamic coastal changes taking place in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska – changes such as increasing storm frequency and coastal erosion, projected increases in shipping traffic, and offshore oil and gas development. With ShoreZone coastal managers have access to data to support planning and response efforts. Dozens of partners are helping to make millions of photos, video, maps, and digital habitat data available online to the public for free.",Andrew Simon,,ShoreZoneOrg@gmail.com,,NA,Salish Sea,https://www.shorezone.org/
"science, monitoring, education, stewardship, vertebrates",Galiano Island Conservancy,Rockfish Conservation Project,GCA-Community outreach RCA non-compliance monitoring,"Compliance is a key factor in ensuring success of marine conservation. We describe a community–academic partnership that seeks to reduce non-compliance of recreational fishers with Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) around Galiano Island in British Columbia, Canada. Previous work showed mostly unintentional non-compliance by recreational fishers. From 2015 to 2018 we developed and implemented outreach and public education activities. We distributed information at community events, and installed 46 metal signs with maps of nearby RCAs at marinas, ferry terminals, and boat launches. During the summers of 2015, 2017, and 2018, we interviewed 86 recreational fishers to gauge their compliance with RCAs. Compared with a baseline in 2014, there was a reduction of 22% (from 25 to 3%) of people who unintentionally fished in RCAs with prohibited gears. In 2018, 67% of participants had seen our outreach materials. We used trail cameras overlooking RCAs to assess non-compliance in six locations on Galiano Island. Illegal fishing incidents within RCAs declined from 42% of days monitored in 2014 to 14% in 2018. Although our outreach efforts were limited in scale and scope, they appear to be making a difference. Our activities and findings can provide guidance for other regions seeking to improve compliance by recreational fishers.",Andrew Simon,Michelle Thompson,oceans@galianoconservancy.ca,UVic,Galiano Island,Galiano Island,https://galianoconservancy.ca/rockfish/
"monitoring, stewardship, conservation, restoration, seagrass, eelgrass",Mayne Island Conservancy,Eelgrass Monitoring,Mayne Island Conservancy - Eelgrass Monitoring,"We are improving knowledge of where eelgrass grows by mapping the extent of eelgrass beds around Mayne Island and surrounding waters. These maps will be added to our database and shared with government agencies, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and community members to help inform decisions about marine management, including fisheries and infrastructure development. Next season, thanks to funding from the Government of Canada and our collaboration with the Galiano Conservancy Association, we’ll map the extent of another 10-15 priority eelgrass hotspots around the southern Gulf Islands. We just found out the Islands Trust Conservancy will also be investing resources to map eelgrass extent in the Islands Trust Area. We will coordinate with them to ensure our efforts are collaborative. We coordinate long-term monitoring of three bays around Mayne Island to detect change in eelgrass extent (Miners Bay, Horton Bay, and Gallagher Bay), in collaboration with the Vancouver Free Diver Club. We work with academic researchers to better understand the causes of eelgrass decline. We work with private land owners to encourage land stewardship practices essential for healthy nearshore habitats. We restore terrestrial habitats such as wetlands and forests to reduce impacts on eelgrass meadows from land.",Andrew Simon,Rob Underhill,biologist@mayneconservancy.ca,,Mayne Island,Southern Gulf Islands,https://mayneconservancy.ca/category/ourwork/our-shorelines/eelgrass-monitoring/
"monitoring, stewardship, conservation, restoration, seagrass, macroalgae",Mayne Island Conservancy,Kelp Bed Monitoring,Mayne Island Conservancy - Kelp Bed Monitoring,"The Mayne Island Conservancy has been mapping the distribution of kelp beds around Mayne Islands since 2008. Staff consulted experts in the field to develop this methodology for mapping by kayak.  It has been prepared for the Seagrass Conservation Working Group, a consortium of community groups, biologists, consultants, First Nations and government agencies who work to conserve nearshore habitats like eelgrass and kelp. This document will be of interest to those undertaking similar activities and they are welcome to make fair use of the information. Community groups undertaking kelp and eelgrass monitoring are encouraged to contact us for advice on how to minimize errors associated with the survey method.",Andrew Simon,Rob Underhill,biologist@mayneconservancy.ca,,Mayne Island,Southern Gulf Islands,https://mayneconservancy.ca/category/ourwork/our-shorelines/kelp-bed-monitoring/
"science, policy, education",Salish Sea Institute,Salish Sea Studies Minor,Salish Sea Studies Minor,"Salish Sea Studies offers a multidisciplinary, experiential, and place-based complement to other majors and minors, including environmental science and policy; marine sciences; international business; anthropology; history; political science; communications; and education. The program is designed to draw on the breadth and depth of expertise across Western, with electives from all colleges on campus. Our curriculum emphasizes appreciation of the contributions of many ways of knowing across the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Students are given opportunities for field-based experiential learning and personal reflection as they develop a critical sense of place in the Salish Sea.",Andrew Simon,Dr. Cindy Elliser,cindy.elliser@wwu.edu,WWU,,,https://salishsea.wwu.edu/salish-sea-studies-minor

"science, seagrass, microbes",Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC),Seagrass Wasting Disease Project,Seagrass Wasting Disease Project,"We aim to understand the complex interaction between the parasite causing seagrass wasting disease, slime nets in the genus Labyrinthula, and their seagrass host. Our work examines the biogeography, diversity, and ecology of seagrass parasites within the genus Labyrinthula, which cause seagrass wasting disease, along both coasts of North and Central America. We are assessing the host specificity of these parasites and the diversity of these parasites associated with dominant seagrasses in temperate and subtropical waters (Zostera marina and Thalassia testudinum) as well as parasites associated with other subtropical seagrasses (e.g., Syringodium filiforme, Halodule wrightii). We are developing new methods, specifically genetic and genomic techniques, for assessing parasite diversity and abundance across seagrass hosts. We are also examining the impact of biotic and abiotic stressors on the progression of seagrass wasting disease.",Andrew Simon,,https://serc.si.edu/about-us/contact-us,,,,https://serc.si.edu/research/projects/seagrass-wasting-disease
